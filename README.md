# piglab - a working environment for snort

## Installation
Note: needs a ruby ~> 2.3

For now:

    git clone https://github.com/ryanbreed/piglab
    cd piglab && bash ./bin/setup

## Usage

There are a bunch of Rake tasks for running snort in various configs.

Use `bundle exec rake -T snort` for more details:

    snort:conf:full      # generate full config
    snort:run:all        # run all rules against all pcaps
    snort:run:only       # run all rules against specific pcap collections
    snort:test:all       # run test rules against all pcaps
    snort:test:only      # run test rules against specific pcap collection
    ...

There is also an interactive pry console for your project:

    13:41 $ bundle exec console
    CURRENT PROJECT: ---
    :project:
      :root: "/Users/ryan/build/piglab"
      :conf_dir: "/Users/ryan/build/piglab/conf"
      :rules_dir: "/Users/ryan/build/piglab/conf/rules"
      ...
      ...
    [1] pry(main)>

where you can interact with snort's configuration:

    [20] pry(main)> puts project.render_snort_conf(expand: true)

or interact with the pcap collection:

    packets = project.readpackets(collection: :boring)

or discover regex patterns in sample strings

    samples = packets.read_streams(:http_client_request).grep(%r{^Directory: })
    project.discover_patterns(strings: samples, expand: :to_re)

    {TODO: example}

or interact with the rule collection.
this disables all of the community rules for SERVER-WEBAPP:

    project.rules.matches_msg("SERVER-WEBAPP") do |collection|
      collection.rules.each do |rule|
        rule.disable if rule.metadata.match(/ruleset community/)
      end
      collection.save!  
    end
